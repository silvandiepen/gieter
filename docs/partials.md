# Partials

Every Markdown file will create it's own page, but what if you don't want to add all data to one Markdown file, or you want to have multiple sections? In that case, you can create "partials". By adding a `-` in front of the filename, the file won't be processed as a page, but as a partial of the parent (index or readme.md).
